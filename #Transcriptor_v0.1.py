#Transcriptor v0.1
    #Transcriptor allows the user to input a genetic sequence (DNA), tells you the number of bp's
    #and outputs the DNA strand, its complement, and the RNA sequence
    #future versions of this program will allow the user to input an RNA sequence originally, as well as 
    #allow the program to read the codons of the sequence and output a protein strand
